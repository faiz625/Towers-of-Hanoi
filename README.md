# Towers-of-Hanoi
In this lab, we were directed to create a functioning code to execute a Towers of Hanoi game. This code implemented a recursive algorithm in order to solve the towers. 

The amount of disks can be editted by inputting the desired amount(n)
(eg. "towers2 3")

If you wanted to input the amount of disks, the starting point and the destination (n, from, dest, respectively)
(eg. "towers2 3 2 3)

Q1: towers(4,2,1)
Q2: 6 calls
Q3: Moves from tower 2 to tower 3 
Q4: towers(3,2,3)
Q5: 2^n -1 -> (2^(8))-1 = 255
